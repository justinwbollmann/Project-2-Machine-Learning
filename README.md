# Project-2-Machine-Learning

As we have seen in class this quarter, the nearest neighbor algorithm is a very simple, yet very competitive classification a
lgorithm. It
does have one major drawback however; it is very sensitive to irrelevant features. With this
in mind you will code up the nearest
neighbor classifier, and then use it inside a “wrapper” which does
two
kinds of searches (listed below)
1)
Forward Selection
2)
Backward Elimination
Don’t be scared by the phrase “search algorithm”,
in this case it is reall
y
simply nested loops, nothing else.
To make life simple, you can assume the following. I will only give you datasets that have two classes. I will only give you
datasets
that have continuous features.
Think carefully before you start coding this. Stude
nts in the past seem to have made this more complicated than it need be. In
particular, in Matlab I was able to write the nearest neighbor algorithm in 8 lines of code, and the
two
search algorithms in another 17
lines of code.
C++ and Java programs tend
to be longer, but even so, I would be surprised if this took more than 100 lines of code (although I will
not penalize you for this).
Very important
: Make sure your nearest neighbor algorithm is working correctly before you attempt the search algorithms.
We will
provide some test datasets for this purpose.
You may use some predefined utility routines, for example sorting routines. However I expect all the major code to be origina
l. You
must document any book, webpage, person or other resources you consu
lt in doing this project (see the first day’s handout).
You may consult colleagues at a high level, discussing ways to implement the tree data structure for example. But you may
not
share
code. At most, you might illustrate something to a colleague wit
h pseudocode.
You will hand in
a report, see
Project_2_sample_report.pdf
You must keep the evolving versions of your code, so that, if necessary
you can demonstrate to the course staff how you went about
solving this problem (in other words, we may ask you to prove that you did the work, rather than copy it from somewhere).
You can use a simple text line interface or a more sophisticated GUI (but don’t waste time making it pretty unless you are su
re it
works and you have lots free time).
However,
your program should have a trace like the one below, so that it can be tested.
The data files will be in the following format. ASCII Text, IEEE standard for 8 place floating numbers. This is a common form
at; you
should be able to find some code to load the data into your program, rather that writing it from scratch (as always, docume
nt borrowed
code). The first column is the class, these values will always be either “1”s or “2”s. The other columns contain the features
, which are
not
normalized. There may be an arbitrary number of features (for simplicity I will cap the maximum number
at 64). There may an
arbitrary number of instances (rows), for simplicity I will cap the maximum number at 2,048. Below is a trivial sample datase
t. The
first record is class “2”, the second is class “1” etc
.
